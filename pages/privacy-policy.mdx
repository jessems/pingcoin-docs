# Privacy Policy

Effective Date: 2023-05-16

This Privacy Policy governs the manner in which Pingcoin ("the App") collects, uses, maintains, and discloses information collected from users (referred to as "User," "you," or "your") of the Pingcoin app on Android devices. This Privacy Policy applies to the App and all services offered by Pingcoin.

Information Collection
1.1 Anonymous IDs: The App collects anonymous identification information solely for the purpose of analytics, support, and continuous improvements to enhance your user experience. These anonymous IDs do not personally identify you and are automatically generated by the App. By using the App, you consent to the collection and usage of these anonymous IDs. Opting out of this data collection is not possible.

1.2 Coin Recording Submission: The App allows users to submit a WAV recording and an image for coin recording purposes. This submission is entirely optional. If you choose to submit a coin recording, you may optionally provide your email address to allow us to contact you if necessary. Providing your email address is voluntary, and it will only be used for the purpose of communication related to your coin recording submission.

Data Collection Limitation
2.1 Except as mentioned in section 1 above, the App does not collect any personal or personally identifiable information (PII) from users. We do not track your location, access your contacts, or collect any sensitive information from your device.

Data Retention
3.1 Anonymous IDs: The App retains the anonymous IDs collected for analytics, support, and improvement purposes indefinitely.

3.2 Coin Recordings: If you choose to submit a coin recording, the App retains the associated WAV recording, image, and any provided email address for a period of up to 90 days. After this period, all PII, including email addresses, will be automatically deleted from our systems.

Security
4.1 We take appropriate measures to protect your information from unauthorized access, alteration, or disclosure. However, please understand that no data transmission over the internet or method of electronic storage can guarantee 100% security. Therefore, while we strive to protect your information, we cannot guarantee its absolute security.

Disclosure of Information
5.1 We do not sell, trade, or rent your information to third parties. However, we may share generic aggregated demographic information not linked to any personal information regarding visitors and users with our business partners, trusted affiliates, and advertisers for the purposes outlined in section 1 above.
